 have learnt the factors that would impact ones driving experience and their financial stability. 
 I do not own a car myself and researching a lot about electric vehicles and the factors one should consider before buying a car was an avenue that I never thought of as much. 
 This made me think about cars as a depreciating asset and dig deeper into fitting the car to your subjective needs before buying it. 
 I am most proud of this because I learnt something about the small factors that would affect ones day to day life and how should one approach about deciding what to do when taking important decisions.
