We are trying to develope a web application that would give a customizaed report by taking into consideration various factors that would effect a customer's experience with respect to EV.

Buying a car is  subjective to everybody and the factors one should consider based on their use case. We create a questionnaire which is based on important factors that would effect EV and the questions are but not limited to 
  . How often do you drive and what is the frequency of your travel.
  . What is the avarage distance you drive in a month?
  . What is your location?
  . WHta is the primary purpose of you buying this car?


Technologies we would be using to develop this are HTML, CSS, Javascript, Firebase. These technologies would help us develop a webpage and have some sort of databse connectivity to take inputs from the users, process their inputs and give out a customized report.
